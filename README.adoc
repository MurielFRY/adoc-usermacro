User macro that allows AsciiDoc (Asciidoctor) blocks inside Confluence pages.

== Description

This macro is designed to render the AsciiDoc body content in the page whilst preserving the original markup code in the macro body, so that subsequent edits of the page can update the original code.
The AsciiDoc code is rendered at page display time by the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js] javascript library.

== Installation

Install the macro through the Confluence Administrator Console.

. Open the `Configuration` page as an administrator.
. Select `Configurations => User Macros => Create a User Macro` in the left navigation panel.
. Complete the `Information` and `Definition` fields based on the information in the Code section.
. Paste the velocity template code (see below) into the `Template` text box.

== Code

The velocity template source code is available in the https://github.com/norganna/adoc-usermacro/blob/master/adoc.velocity[adoc.velocity] file on GitHub.

== Disabling Asciidoctor Foundation Styles

The macro uses the Foundation Asciidoctor styles to present the code when it is saved.

  <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="//www.norganna.com/cdn/css/adoc.css" media="all">

If you want to keep the stock Confluence Look and Feel, comment out this line in the macro code.

NOTE: You will need to do some modifications to the Confluence CSS to make sure it adds the correct whitespace present in standard Confluence Wiki pages.
Confluence does not seem to like <div> blocks with attributes defined, which is standard in Asciidoctor HTML5 output.

== Usage

You can use this Confluence Macro multiple times per page.

Choose one of the following insertion methods:

Use the Pretty Macro::
  Paste your Asciidoctor text into the code window.
Use the Raw Macro::
  Paste your Asciidoctor text between the `{adoc}` tag like this:
