User macro that allows AsciiDoc (Asciidoctor) blocks inside Confluence pages.

toc::[]

== Description

This macro is designed to render the AsciiDoc body content in the page whilst preserving the original markup code in the macro body, so that subsequent edits of the page can update the original code.
The AsciiDoc code is rendered at page display time by the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js] javascript library.

== Installation

Install the macro through the Confluence Administrator Console.

. Open the `Configuration` page as an administrator.
. Select `Configurations => User Macros => Create a User Macro` in the left navigation panel.
. Complete the `Information` and `Definition` fields based on the information in the Code section.
. Paste the velocity template code (see below) into the `Template` text box.

NOTE: This macro will work better with an additional Confluence macro installed. See <<Whitespace>> for more information.

== Code

The velocity template source code is available in the https://github.com/norganna/adoc-usermacro/blob/master/adoc.velocity[adoc.velocity] file on GitHub.

== Disabling Asciidoctor Foundation Styles

The macro uses the Foundation Asciidoctor styles by default to present the code when it is saved.

  <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="//www.norganna.com/cdn/css/adoc-foundation.css" media="all">

If you want to get the stock Confluence Look and Feel, change the css filename to adoc-confluence.css instead. If you remove this class completely you will be left with a mess due to the heavy use of container <div>s in the Asciidoctor HTML5 output

== Usage

You can use this Confluence Macro multiple times per page.

Choose one of the following insertion methods:

Use the Pretty Macro::
  Paste your Asciidoctor text into the code window.
Use the Raw Macro::
  Paste your Asciidoctor text between the `{adoc}` tag like this:

.Macro Usage
[source,asciidoc]
----
{adoc}
= Hello, AsciiDoc!
Doc Writer <doc@example.com>

An introduction to http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc].


== Header 2

Content content.

* List item 1
* List item 2
{adoc}
----

[[Whitespace]]
== Confluence Pretty Macro Blocks Strip Out Whitespace

You'll notice that if you paste your AsciiDoc text directly into the `{adoc}` pretty macro, all the meaningful whitespace is stripped out. 

There's no polite way of saying this: the Confluence WYSIWYG editor is less than perfect when editing anything *other than* Wiki markup.

=== Bring up the Insert Markup dialog

. Create or edit your page in Confluence.
. Position your cursor at the location you want your document inserted.
. Click the drop-down button in the editor toolbar denoted by a plus icon.
. Select the Markup option from the drop-down menu.

=== Enter the desired Confluence markup code directly

. Type {adoc} and press enter.
. Paste your AsciiDoc code and press enter.
. Type {adoc} again at the end.
+
NOTE: The right side of the window will update with the content to be inserted.
. Click the Insert button at the bottom of the dialog to complete the insertion.
